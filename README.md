# VOCABULARY NOTES APP

This application was explained in a course on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9b6wgodx-C3VRvma06Lz6Y7-fr5fMy6K), where we learned the basics of working with Hive Flutter through practical application on this project .

## Project Objective

This application provides a solution to the problem of word recall when learning new languages. 
With this application, you can add words in either Arabic or English, and for each word, you can add synonyms and examples of context in both Arabic and English languages. 
For ease of word recall and searching, the application allows you to filter your words based on language, number of letters, and also based on the timing of the addition.

## Project Overview
When you open the application, you will see the Home Screen that contains all the words you have added before.

![Alt text](<5-English Filter 2.jpg>)

But here we want to display only the Arabic words.
